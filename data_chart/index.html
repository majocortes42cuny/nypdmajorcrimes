<!-- When I chose the topic for this data chart, I expected to provide evidence of the commissioner’s positive performance in the major crimes categories. However, I was surprised to find that the numbers contradicted the claims made by Adams and Mamdani. It also caught my attention how reports are presented to the public in a way that allows officials to easily claim that things are moving in the right direction.  -->

<h1> Is the NYPD Commissioner doing a god job? What the numbers tell us </h1>

<h3>Despite praise for her leadership, recent NYPD data reveals a troubling 10% rise in major crimes over the past year, challenging the narrative of progress under Commissioner Tisch.</h3>

<p> New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch announced Wednesday that she had accepted Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's offer to remain in her position when he takes office in January. “I have admired her work cracking down on corruption in the upper echelons of the police department and driving down crime in New York City,” Mamdani commented on November 19 about Tisch’s leadership of the NYPD throughout last year.</p>

<p>But the numbers on major crimes trends over the last year tell a different story. According to the NYPD reports from October 2024 to September 2025, major crimes increased by about 10% overall. Total major crimes increased from 29,642 in October last year to 32,625 in September, a steady upward trend after a decline from January to March of this year.</p> 

<p>“These trends shows that the punitive approach to policing represented by Commissioner Tisch does not necessarily reduce crime. It also opens the door for Mayor-elect Mamdani to explore alternatives—both to Tisch and to the punitive approach to law enforcement in the city”, said Maurizio Guerrero, PhD candidate studying surveillance, author, and journalist.</p> 

<p>The main increases in major crimes were in auto theft, which rose 16.7%, followed by major theft, up 13.6%. There were also troubling increases in felony assault, which rose 11%, and rape, up 8%. The main decreases occurred in burglary, 6%, and murder, 3%.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <i>Murder and rape are presented in a separate chart due to their significantly lower incidence compared with other crime categories.</i></p>
